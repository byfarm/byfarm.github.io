This part was completed using numpy. I then wanted to expand upon the two player game to create a bot to play against. I chose to recreate the Alpha Zero algorithm. Needless to say, it did not end up being successfull. It was one of the first software projects I undertook though and I had fun and learned a lot about how Neural Networks and chess bots worked."
            data-improvement-body="The program seemed at times to get stuck playing the same moves all the time when training itself. This implied that it was reaching a local minima with its loss function. A way to improve this would be to play around with the NN's parameters to see if it is able to break out of the minima. I also believe that the network I was using was much too small (100's of nodes). An expantion to many more nodes would help."

The brains of the was an Arduino that took in data from the sensors and commanded the wheels how to move. The project was completed successfully and the robot escaped the maze."
