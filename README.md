            data-summary-body="The final project for my Freshman Seminar class at Gonzaga University, this project's goal was to program a robot to autonomously escape from a maze. The robot had a swiveling head that had an ultrasonic and light sensor attached to it, and it used two servo motors attaches to some wheels that helped it move around. The brains of the was an Arduino that took in data from the sensors and commanded the wheels how to move. The project was completed successfully and the robot escaped the maze."
            data-improvement-body="Having the Arduino draw power from the batteries on board instead of from the computer attached to it would have made the project go a lot smoother, as our group would have to move around with the arduino as it completed the challenge, making sure not to tug on it with the cord attached to it."
